Here we go:
1.	Preserve all of the requirements I have mentioned above
2.	Install the Oracle VM VirtualBox app, and get it done. About how to install it step by step, I would point you to an article that provide more details; [VirtualBox Installation Tutorial](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html)
3.	Install the Ubuntu Server ISO file on Oracle VM VirtualBox app. As usual I won’t tell you how to do it, instead I could offer an article about it, because it will be cost me more time and space, also it’s not our main objective right here. Here’s the article; [Ubuntu Server Installation Tutorial](https://adinusa.id/content/post/blogs/panduan-install-ubuntu-server-di-virtualbox/)
4.	Make 2 VMs by following instructions from number before, one for the web server and one for the database server
5.	In this section, we’re going easy with these stuff by installing LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), a bundle that include all of those program that we needed. The full instructions could be discovered here; [LAMP Installation Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-22-04), we’re doing this for both VM
6.	After all of those stuff have been installed, we’re going to setup the databases in its server, we could go into a website; [Wordpress on Ubuntu Installation Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-wordpress-on-ubuntu), make 3 databases and its user, get it done, and we’re continuing to next step

7.	Done with the databases, go for the wordpress CMS installation, I have mentioned the instructions link at number 6, make it well, and then proceed to the next step

9.	Done installing the wordpress CMS, next we’re going to connect wordpress VM to databases VM, here’s the reference; [Wordpress Remote Database Tutorial](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/configure-wordpress-remote-database/)
10.	This is how it looks when it done having a connection between wordpress VM and database VM
