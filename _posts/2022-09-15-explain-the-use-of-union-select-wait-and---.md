1.	`UNION`  
The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more `SELECT` statements.
- Every `SELECT` statement within `UNION` must have the same number of columns
- The columns must also have similar data types
- The columns in every `SELECT` statement must also be in the same order

2.	`SELECT`  
The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set

3.	`WAIT`  
Hmm, about `WAIT`, we‚Äôre going to use `SLEEP` because `WAIT` command is not available in MySQL. `SLEEP` is a command to put a delay on an output before it gets returned.

4.	`--`  
`--` is one of three comment styles that available in MySQL
