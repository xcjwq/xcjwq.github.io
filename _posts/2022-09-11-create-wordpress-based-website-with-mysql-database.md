## Prerequisites:
- Windows OS
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- [Wordpress package](https://wordpress.org/download/)
- Some good internet connection

## Here we go:
1.	Download XAMPP on the website, and adjust the version into the one you prefer

3.	Finished the installation (don’t check the box for start the control panel), get a restart for your machine, so XAMPP will have fresh start next (actually, restarting is not that necessary, but why not?)

4.	Upon booting up, search for XAMPP and ALWAYS run it as administrator to let it work properly
